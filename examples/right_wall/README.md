# Algo.py

In Algo.py  the algorithm in the article is implemented , so we can see that all drone states will be shown ,
as well as drone simulation using Airsim .



# States:
 - In our Algorithm 5  states are represented : 

 ###  Rotate C.C.W :slightly rotates counterclockwise(to align with the right wall).
        
 ### Emergency : Drone brakes to avoid crashing
       
 ### Tunnel :Drone centers in between the left and right walls while maintaining the  desired speed.
       
 ### Turn_CW: Drone turns 90 degrees clockwise (to find the right wall)
     
 ### FlyForward: Drone flies forward while making minor adjustments to maintain predefined bounds, i.e., its distance from the right and the desired speed.
